Specification
=============

For the words see [the glossary](https://github.com/AllYarnsAreBeautiful/ayab-desktop/wiki/Glossary)

Design Decisions
----------------

Concerns:

- We can never implement everything that is possible with knitting. We must therefore allow instructions to be arbitrary.
- We can not use a grid as a basis. This does not reflect if you split the work and make i.e. two big legs
- Knitting can be done on the right and on the wrong side. The same result can be achived when knitting in both directions. 

Assumptions
-----------

- we start from bottom right
- default instruction ([see](https://github.com/AllYarnsAreBeautiful/ayab-desktop/wiki/2016-05-25---Knitting-pattern))

        {
          "type" : "knit", 
        }
        {
          "type" : "ktog tbl", # identifier
          "count" : 2
        }
    
- default connection

        {
          "start" : 0,
        }
        
- `"id"` can point to an object.
