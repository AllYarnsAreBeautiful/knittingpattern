Design Decisions
----------------

Concerns:

- We can never implement everything that is possible with knitting. We must therefore allow instructions to be arbitrary.
- We can not use a grid as a basis. This does not reflect if you split the work and make i.e. two big legs
- Knitting can be done on the right and on the wrong side. The same result can be achived when knitting in both directions.
